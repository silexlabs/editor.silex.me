## Silex instances by Silex Labs

This repo holds the code for the [public Silex instance hosted for free by Silex Labs foundation](https://editor.silex.me) and [The v3 instance too](https://v3.silex.me).

This is also a good example on how to customize Silex. And it has a Dockerfile for easy deployment

## Features

This code adds features to the editor specific to our instance (in `index.js` and `index.pug`):

* [x] Multi-site with the Dashboard plugin
* [x] Automatic deployment to [CapRover](https://caprover.com/) (see the captain-definition file and the file `.github/workflows/caprover.yml`)
* [x] Onboarding: Send an email with [brevo the 1st time we see a user](https://brevo.co/) + use Silex notification system to guide users through the first steps
* [x] Enable or disable cloud services and hosting providers with env vars
* [ ] Analytics: add a tag in Silex editor
